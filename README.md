# DestinyLFGJoinInviteCopier
Simple BetterDiscord Plugin to make copying /join /invite easier

This code is heavily based on the plugin:

https://betterdiscord.app/plugin/RedditMentions


You need to install BetterDiscord To Test it out


https://betterdiscord.app/


I'm not publishing the plugin publicly on BetterDiscord til i fix and improve parsing of /join /invite and make them as hyperlinks instead of extra text 

Once you install BetterDiscord, just place the file DestinyLFGJoinInviteCopier.plugin.js into the plugins folder
